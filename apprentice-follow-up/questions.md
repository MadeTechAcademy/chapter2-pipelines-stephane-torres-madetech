## Part 1
Answer these after a day or two after the course 

1. Which exercise did you find the easiest? and why<br/>
    I found exercise 2 and 4 to be the easiest/easier, after completing exercise 1 and understanding a bit of what the YAML file needs to include and how it needs to be structured to run a job, exercise 2 was just a case of changing the trigger everything else remained the same.
    Exercise 4 became a lot easier when gaining a little bit more understanding the a runner is just a machine that we can plug commands into and that ubuntu has docker out of the box so the pipeline ends up being extremely simple.
2. Which was most difficult? and why<br/>
    I found exercise 1 and 3 to be the harder of the exercises, the idea of plugins and how to use them as well as what different steps, structure and blocks we need in our YAML files to get a pipeline to work to begin with we quite difficult to get along with. Also not knowing what is happening at the end of each step.


## Part 2

After some reflection and perhaps investigation while on your delivery

1. Which pipeline types are used on your delivery?
2. What techniques are in place that make pipelines more secure on your delivery?
3. Describe something you have learned that you were able to use directly in your delivery.
